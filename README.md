# Machine-Learning

I am going to be using the fllowing repository: [hanson-ml](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml) and all of the installation & code will be previewed in Windows, so if you are using MacOS or Linux please follow the steps of the below repo.

## installation

Install Python from the [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Also make sure you are using Python >= 2.6 (**Python 3.6.X** is preferable because Python 3.7 at this moment is not compatible with Tensorflow)
Make sure to **add** python to the environment path.

### Using pip

Make sure you have the latest version of pip installed:<br>
`$ pip install --user --upgrade pip`<br>
Next we have to use pip to install all the required python packages:<br>
`$ pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt`<br>
This will take several minutes, when it finishes you will be ready to go!
